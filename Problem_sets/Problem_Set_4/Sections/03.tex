\section{Problem 3 (2 points)}
\textbf{In the recording/mastering of sound signals or during playback, it is often desired to alter the characteristics of the sound at different frequencies. For example, we may wish to highlight the lower/middle frequencies, while we may wish to reduce the presence of high frequencies.This can be done by using so-called 'shelving' filters. Figure \ref{fig:Low-frequency_shelving_filter.png} shows a low-frequency shelving filter implementation. The filter \( A(z) \) is :
\[A(z)=\frac{\alpha-z^{-1}}{1-\alpha z^{-1}}\]
The parameters \( \alpha \) and \( K \) are used to \textit{tune} the filter.}
