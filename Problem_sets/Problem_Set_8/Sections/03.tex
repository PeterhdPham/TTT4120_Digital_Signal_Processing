\section{Problem 3 (5 points)}
\textbf{In this problem you should make a vowel transformer that lets you record a vowel, and then transforms it to any desired Norwegian vowel pronounced in your own voice. This problem requires the use of headphones and microphone.
One sample of each Norwegian vowel can be downloaded from It's learning. Start by converting one of those vowels to other vowels.
When recording your own vowels you should use the sampling frequency $F_s=8 \mathrm{kHz}$, and make sure to extract only the file part containing the vowel before proceeding.
Hint: Vowels can be regarded as stationary signals, and are well modeled as $\mathrm{AR}[10]$ processes.
Useful Matlab functions are audioread, audiorecorder, lpc, filter and sound.}
