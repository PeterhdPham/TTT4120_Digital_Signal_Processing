\section{Problem 5 (2 points)}

The signal

\begin{equation*}
    x[n]=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}n+1 & 0 \leq n \leq 2 \\ 0 & \text { otherwise }\end{array}\right. 
\end{equation*}

is passed through two systems as shown in Figure \ref{fig:5}

\importimagewcaption{5}{Filtering with two systems}

The unit sampleresponse of the systems are given by

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{l}h_{1}[n]=\delta[n]+\delta[n-1]+\delta[n-2] \\ h_{2}[n]=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0.9^{n} & 0 \leq n \leq 10 \\ 0 & \text { otherwise }\end{array}\right.\end{array}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection*{(a) Compute and sketch the signal $y_1[n]$.}

\subsubsection*{use Python to compute and plot the signal $y_2[n]$. }

\importimage{5b}

\subsubsection*{(c) What is the relationship between signal lengths at the input and the output of the two systems?}

Thte relastionship between signal lengths at the input and the output of the two systems is that the lenght of the lenghts of the output array is equal to the lenght of the input signal {N} plus the lenght of the system function {M} minus 1; {N+M-1}.

\subsubsection*{(d) UsePython to compute and plot the signals $y_1[n]$ and $y_2[n]$ when the order of the two systems is interchanged. Compare with the plots in (a) and (b) and comment.}

When compared with the plots in (a) and (b):

We can se that the subsystems are commutative, as the output signal $y_2$ is the same regardeless of what subsystem the signal passes thrugh first.
