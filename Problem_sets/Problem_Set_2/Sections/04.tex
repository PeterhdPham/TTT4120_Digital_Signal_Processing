\section{Problem 4 (2 points)}
\textbf{The analog signal $ x_{a}(t) $ is given by\[x_{a}(t)=\cos (2000 \pi t) .\]The spectrum of $ x_{a}(t) $ is shown in the figure below}

\subsection*{(a) Two time-discrete signals, $ x_{1}[n] $ and $ x_{2}[n] $, are generated by sampling the signal $ x_{a}[n] $ using the sampling frequencies $ F_{s}=4000 \mathrm{~Hz} $ and $ F_{s}=1500 \mathrm{~Hz} $, respectively.Sketch the spectra of the two sampled signals, $ X_{1}(f) $ and $ X_{2}(f) $, for $ f \in\left[-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right] $.}

\subsection*{(b) Use Matlab or Python to generate a segment of both time-discrete signals corresponding to the signal duration of $ 1 \mathrm{~s} $.Play the two signal segments using Matlab function sound or the Python command sounddevice.play with the corresponding sampling frequencies.Why do they sound differently when they both represent the same analog signal?}

No the first has a higher pitch than the second.
