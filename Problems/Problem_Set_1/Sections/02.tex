\section{Problem 2 (2 points)}

\subsection*{(a) Which physical frequencies $F_1$ can $f_1$ correspond to if $F_s = 6000Hz$?}
As the sampling frequency need to be twice as high as the frequency after sampling we get from the equation:

\begin{equation*}
    -\frac{F_s}{2}\leq f \leq \frac{F_s}{2}
\end{equation*}

this gives us:

\begin{equation*}
    -3000Hz\leq f \leq 3000Hz
\end{equation*}
